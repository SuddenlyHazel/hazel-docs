# User & Builder Owned Software
> Disclaimer this is a living document and my views here are subject to change as I work and reach new conclusions. I'd love to hear your own thoughts too. 


## Intro

This document will contain my stream of conciseness as I explore some ideas around alternative funding and ownership models for Software. 

I'm particularly interested diving into models which could utilize emerging platforms like [Dfinity](https://dfinity.org/), that might be able to empower small groups of developers to serve software at scales not otherwise possible.

## Background

Today, we share the daily happening of our lives, connect with friends and loved ones on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Twitch, Patreon, OnlyFans, and Etsy have captured the attention of Creators who are generating some or all of their livelihood from these services. Apps like Uber and Instacart provide mechanisms for people to convert their time (and equity..) into cash. Venmo and CashApp let us send money instantly to our friends and family. Amazon.. Well, Amazon is just consuming and destroying everything they touch... In a lot of ways, the average person has grown to rely on these services like we would public utilities. As such, you can find many who advocate for this! _Personally, I am not a proponent of this._

In the business world SaaS like SquareSpace, Wix, Freshbooks, HubSpot, Paypal, Square, and Shopify have become the backbone of many SMB operations. Developers are trying to build businesses creating games and apps for platforms created by companies like Google and Apple.

Our money and attention are ever increasingly flowing into digital goods and services. Can you think of a service I haven't mentioned but accounted an astronomical ~73 Billion hours of human attention in 2020? - Netflix :) 

Given the resources, us humans will connect the living hell out of things huh? It is without a doubt an incredibly interesting time to exist. So many parts of our lives have been touched by the explosion of innovation radiating out from the aforementioned companies.

## The Problem

Now, I love technology. I was among the first flocking to GMail from Yahoo. And, as a younger person I encouraged my friends to create a Facebook account in lieu of MySpace. My user persona might be considered an "Early Adopter".

These platform shifts were incremental improvements. 

It saddens me to say that, frankly, I'm sicked by where many of these companies have ended up. Before we proceed, **I want to stop for a moment**, and put it on the record that none of these feeling are towards the people working at these companies, but rather the institution.

Our tech companies have a problem. Go ask 10 of your friends if company X is "Evil" and I'd wager the majority will say yes. Have we've come to believe that technological innovation can't happen without detrimental effects, have people just become complacent and addicted, or do we not believe alternatives can exist. I'm not sure. More likely, it is associated to why people litter, how people struggle to visualize compounding effects, and that viable alternatives weren't possible until recently.

1. Out of Sight Out of Mind
2. Instant Gratification
3. Platform Domination

Regardless, this isn't about shaming people for using these tools. I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SuddenlyHazel), I watch YouTube, and use Spotify. These products serve a purpose in our lives. It would be hilariously ignorant of me to shame someone posting their videos on YouTube, or cast judgment on family for using Facebook. 

So, people think there is a problem, but what exactly is it? Well, its complicated, but here are a few I've identified.

1. The product has negative long term or second degree effects. 
2. The product helps creators make money, but:
	1. The return is very little
	2. The platform it too prohibitive
	3. Too unstable.
3. The product is a marketplace, but:
	1. The fee structure is misaligned
	2. The rules are applied selectively
4. Users voices aren't heard.

Next, I argue that these issues are caused by at least one of the following:

1. You're the product.
2. You're not paying the bills.
3. You're paying the bills,
