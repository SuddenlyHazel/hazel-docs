# Cycles

## What are they?

On the internet computer computation can be thought a unit of currency.  The price of Cycles should be stable. Moreover, Cycles are transferable between Canisters - Programmatically!

## Cycles and Price Stability

The price of cycles [should remain constant over time](https://twitter.com/dominic_w/status/1336779068713226241), but over large intervals of time each cycle will be able to execute more computation.

> When ICP tokens are converted into cycles and burned by computation, the effect is deflationary because it reduces the supply. The value of cycles will stay approximately constant, which ensures that the cost of computation remains stable.

> The Internet Computer’s use of computation to produce a stable value for cycles is potentially revolutionary. Holders of cycle tokens receive a guarantee that — so long as the Internet Computer network is running — eventually all surplus cycles will be burned, and the value of their cycles will return to its usual peg.
